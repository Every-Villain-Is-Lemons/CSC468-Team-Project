Deliverable 2:
- Updated technical report PDF (20/30 available points)
   - Chapter (Intermediate Milestones) what have we done so far/accomplished, what are we struggling with?
   - Need to add Summary section too (f/ deliverable 1)
- Single slide presentation, talk about what we designed for 10 minutes (5/30)
   - Make it 24" by 36" (think of it as a comprehensive architectural design w/ detailed notation/description
   - Should contain URL to GitHub repo
   - SHOULD BE PROFESSIONAL
- Presentation (5/30) - April 18th and 20th
   - IF YOU DON'T SHOW UP BOTH DAYS, 0 POINTS
   - Hang around alumni weekend to present to people for at least 2 hours gets 5% bonus towards midterm

Both the PDF and slide go onto GitHub repo

Plan of Attack:
1) create operational generator and hasher (python, ruby, reverse?)
2) get worker to be able to call generator and hasher to get target hashes and solve them
3) figure out how to log the successes to MySQL db
4) craft webui that pulls dynamic data from MySQL db
